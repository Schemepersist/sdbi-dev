General:

Don't forget to prevent your backup systems from trying to backup raw
database files, unless perhaps if the backup systems use the
filesystem stack to create snapshots, in which case you can hope the
database recovery mechanism will do the right thing if it's being
modified while being backed up.


SQLite3:

Should already be installed on your system, zero-admin to the point of
having an in memory database using ":memory:".


PostgreSQL:
